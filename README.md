# PyPoetWeb
Web app that generates poetry from large bodies of text.

Frameworks and Libraries:
Natural Language Processing Library

Note: My design philosophy emphasizes simplicity, and I did not enjoy adding all these dependencies, but it was necessary and truly attests to the complexity of the project.
